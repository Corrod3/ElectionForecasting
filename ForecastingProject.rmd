# Introduction


The digitialization is challenging the way polling was done for many decades. Calling people on their landline phones has become difficult as response rates drop and households equiped with such phones are getting less and less (CITE). In response polling institutions have started to use other methods for polling ranging from face-to-face interviews to mobile phone calling. But they proven difficult to ensure representativeness or are expensive. To tackle this problem, pollsters began to experiment with non-representative polling methods (Wang).

In our forecasting project we want to use non-representative polling data from mobile-phone app users. 

1. Surveys are in hardly any case representative; weighting is part of every survey practice;populations consist of different strata; those can be chosen beforehand (stratification) or afterwards (post-stratification)

2. Dalia data, forecoast on 2017 election; needs to be weightened; we will do that using exit polls (alternatively census data?)

<!-- from Lumpley slides
Nonresponse introduces statistical inefficiency
•Nonresponse will also lead to biased estimates if the propensity to respond to the survey(or an item) is related to the attribute of interest
•Ex ante attempts to reduce unit and item nonreponse seldom are fully successful (e.g. increase and dispersion of contact attempts, incentives, conversion by specially trained interviewers, reduction of respondent burden/ interview length via matrix sampling etc.)
•Non response rate and non response bias seem hardly related
•Importance ofex post strategies for missing data
•Different strategies are based on different assumptions about missingness and different kinds of information available on those missing

Poststratification
•Ex poststratification of the sample along one or several categorical variables x…
-… which are suspected to co-determine missingness and the attribute of interest y („commoncauses“ according to Groves, 2006)
-… whose (joint) population distribution is known
•Conceive of the categories/ cross-classifications of x as groups or strata h, use the stratified estimator
•Corrects for disproportionalities between NhN and nh′N that may be either due to sampling or due to non response
•Assumes MAR

Raking
-> if only marginal distributions are known (as for example with the forschungsgruppe wahlen)

# Data

The forecasting project utilizes data from the Europulse Survey which is conducted quarterly by Dalia Research in all EU countries. The survey consists of seven waves, but for this project we only use two waves of the survey from December 2016 and March 2017. The first wave is freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/daliaresearch/trump-effect), the second wave was provided to us directly by Dalia Research. Each wave consists of about 11000 individuals, of which roughly 1900 were from Germany. The data is already pre-stratified by Dalia Research based on micro zensus data for age and gender. 

In order to post-stratify the data, we want to use different sources and compare their effect on the forecast: (1) exit poll data from Forschungsgruppe Wahlen or intratest dimap Institute (what), (2) representative election statistics and (3) microzensus data. 

(how did we get the data...)

# Empirical Strategy

For stratifying the data we orient ourself at the work of XXX. The basic idea is to compute clusters of voters along several demographic categories and use their past votes to compute weights.

First, if possible we use post-stratification (see Lumpley, ch. 7?) to compute weights for subgroups in the sample. Post-stratification tries to make a sample representative of the actual population by ensuring the relative size of subgroup resembles the relative size of the same subgroup in the 'true' population. For forecasting the 'true' population is not known, as it is a question of who will actually turn out to vote. 

How we plan to make poll representative

Compare different stratification approaches

Likely problems we will encounter: 1. empthy clusters or clusters with low number of observations. Implications: If empthy, there is a real problem. If the number of observation is low, e.g. below 20, the weigths will will amplify the impact of this small group in the total forecasting result.

Benchmark -> other publically available polls. This is straight-forward, but also problematic as it might induce a herding effect. The final evaluation is only possibe after the election


# Data Overview

how representative our data already is

1. raw data forecast. Compared to other forecastes the data under represents the CDU as well as the SPD. (Verify) 

2. Show distribution of respondents on different demographic clusters and compare to zensus / exit polls / election statistics

3. Raw (voted last election)

# Results

What the result is of making it representative

1. Election forecast Weighted with exit polls

2. Election forecast weighted with election statics 

3. Election forecast weighted with zensus

Compare the three different weighten approaches
