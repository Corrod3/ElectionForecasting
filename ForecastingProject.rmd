# Introduction

Polling

1. Surveys are in hardly any case representative; weighting is part of every survey practice;populations consist of different strata; those can be chosen beforehand (stratification) or afterwards (post-stratification)

2. Dalia data, forecoast on 2017 election; needs to be weightened; we will do that using exit polls (alternatively census data?)

3. Chapter 2 surveys the literature and discusses alternative approaches
