  \multicolumn{9}{p{0.88\linewidth}}{\scriptsize\textbf{Notes}: The benchmark is the rolling average of all german major polls as computed by \textit{SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung}. GAV stands for Strata combined of the variables gender, age and self-reported vote at the last election. GAR indicates Strata of gender, age and religion. The last row of each month represents the raw results without weighting as collected by Dalia Research.}

What the result is of making it representative

1. Election forecast Weighted with exit polls

2. Election forecast weighted with election statics 

3. Election forecast weighted with zensus

Compare the three different weighten approaches

Comment Moritz: I think we have to weight the data with Zensus data in any case at least for gender and age as long we don't want to use the Dalia weights; then we can either use election statistics or exit poll data (that we don't have)

My approach would be:

1. Weighting with Zensus (accounts for self-selection of the survey)
2. Different mixes of weighting with election statistics with education
(accounts for likely voter bias)
