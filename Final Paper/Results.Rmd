<!-- Results -->

Our results show that the choice of weighting method has a considerable effect on the performance of the forecast against our benchmark data. Moreover, we could show that proper and transparent weighting with publicly available elections statistics and census is feasible and leads to representative and reasonable forecasts from non-representative online poll. Table \ref{tab:results} displays how the raw and the adjusted results for  December 2016 and March 2017 perform in comparison to the *Süddeutsche Zeitung's (SZ)* rolling average using the root mean squared error (RMSE) as indicator of accuracy.

GAV stands for Strata combined of the variables gender, age and self-reported vote at the last election. GAR indicates Strata of gender, age and religion.

As the table shows, the divergence of the raw data was relatively high compared to the average of official polls. The raw forecast has a RMSE of 5.83 for December and 4.75 in March. Yet, with our weighting approach using Census data we were able to improve this performance only by a negligible amount. Employing clusters of gender, age and religion our forecasts show a RMSE of 5.55 and 4.61 respectively. The weak performance might be due to several reasons. As stated earlier, the Dalia data is pre-stratified with age and gender by the time the poll is conducted. We decided, however, to account for age and gender through census data since we did not transparently evaluate Dalia's procedure for stratification. Yet, the very low difference of our estimate with Census data and the original data shows that our approach did not siginificantly differ from Dalia's approach. Moreover, the variable religion does not seem to have a reasonable impact on our weights, which is also partially a result of the fact the religious groups and the Dalia religious category do not perfectly overlap. The census counts religious communities according to German public law (Islam is not one) while the Dalia survey askes for self-reported religious affiliation. We adjusted the post-stratified data for the likely voter, but this had only a relatively small impact on the vote shares.

In contrast, our approach using the election statistics does perform very well compared to census data. Weighting with cluster of age, gender and vote decision and taking into account self-reported vote at the past election yields results in RMSE values of 2.17 and 2.05 respectively compared to our benchmark. Figure \ref{fig:weightedplot} contrasts the raw data with our weighted estimates for December and March.

The results are very promising. They show the possibility of adjusting online polling data with exclusively public available information in a way that they converge to professionally conducted traditional polls. While our results are not conclusive to assess the usefulness of online polls for election forecasting in general, we can, however, state that our two weighted samples are doing well. In addition, looking on the time dimension yields further insights. Figure \ref{fig:rollingaverage} shows the trend of the poll's rolling average since 2016. The dots display our adjusted data.

This shows, how close our data is to the benchmark and that it picked up the large shift in vote shares for the SPD - the so called "Schulz-Effect" - after the annoucement of Martin Schulz as chancelor candidate. Moreover, our estimates are largely within the confidence intervals of the aggregated polls (colored areas below and above the rolling average line). While this illustrates that the online polls adjusted by age, gender and last vote are a significant improvement to the raw data there is still considerable room for improvement. This could be achieved either by using more detailed clusters, different approaches to account for likely voter bias or other data sources such as exit polls of different polling institutes.
