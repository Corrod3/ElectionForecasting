<!-- problems of traditional polling -->
Traditional polling and in particular election polling has relied heavily on telephone surveys for the last decades. To ensure representativeness, the standard was randomized digit dialing (RDD). The selection of random respondents was intended to eliminate the sample bias of the survey. However, for several reasons this approach has become unreliable. First, response rates have declined heavily [@Keeter.2006; @Holbrook.2007]. The @PewResearchCenter.2012  reported that in the U.S. response rates dropped down to 9% in 2012, compared to 36% in 1997. This is fostered by technical changes that, for instance, make it possible to identify the caller before taking the call and increased the likelihood of people not answering survey requests. Second, more and more people do not get landline telephones after moving to new places or give them up as mobile phone and other means of communication have increasingly become popular. As a result, random polls are often exposed to non-response bias mitigating the probabilistic approach of RDD. Nowadays, classical representative polling is less reliable, a trend that will rather continue than cease. Unsurprisingly, lacking representativeness of surveys has been identified as a core reason for recent election polling failures, e.g. in the UK General elections 2015 [@Mellon.2015].

Can non-representative online polls fix this problem? Since the famously failure of the Literature Digest poll in the 1936 U.S. presidential election, pollsters have been sceptical of non-representative polling [@Squire.1988; @Goel.2017] and this scepticism is still widespread. @Yeager.2011, for example, argue that phone surveys are still more accurate than online polls. However, they base their argument on simple correction approaches for non-probability sampled online polls.^[@Goel.2017 [Footnote 2] where able to get more accurate results using the basic approach, but in a different way.]

@Wang.2015 in contrast are much more optimistic about the possibilities of non-representative polling. They used polling results from XBox users, which were highly unrepresentative of the population, to forecast the 2012 U.S. presidential elections. By employing a sophisticated multi-stage approach to post-stratify and calibrate the data they were able to generate accurate forecasts. However, their methodology is mainly suited for large data sets which have sufficient observations for the combined sub-groups (strata) in the sample. @Goel.2017 showed that smaller non-representative online surveys can also be accurate. They  conducted polls on [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and a mobile phone app and achieved a level of accuracy sufficient for most practical applications. These works shows that online survey can be used in a meaningful way, if appropriate methods are used to stratify and calibrate the non-representative data. Still, how such methods perform for the case of election forecasting remains contested.

Likely voter modelling is notoriously the secret-sauce aspect of polling, says Kennedy Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center in Washington DC (from @Skibba.2016)
