<!-- Methodology -->

We want to employ two approaches to generate election forecasts from our data. In the first approach, the survey data is adjusted in a two step procedure: First, the representativeness of survey data to the general population is increased by finding appropiate weights. Then, a likely voter model is used to obtain an election forecast. Our second approach does this in one step: The survey data will be directly adjusted to the likely voter population based on exit poll data from the German federal election in 2013.

## Post-stratifiation

In order to follow both procedures, we need methods to compute weights for different strata of the survey sample aiming at increased representativeness. A classical way to get these weights is *raking*. With raking weights are assigned to each respondent in order to match the marginal distribution of characteristics in the 'true' population. For example, if we know the distribution of education level and employment status in the population we can compute a weight for each so that the weighted survey sample has the same distribution of the characteristics as the 'true' population. Basically, raking estimates a joint distributions for each combination of characteristics. 

However, raking is not ideal. It is often used if only marginal probabilities are available. However, if the joint distribution of characteristics is known we can use *post-stratification* instead. In contrast to raking, post-stratification takes the distribution of combinations of characteristics in the population into account. In other words: It sub-divides the population into groups according to their characteristics. Formally, the post-stratification estimator can be expressed as follows [@Goel.2017, @Lohr.2010[p. 142f.]]:

\begin{equation}
 \hat y^{post} = \frac{\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_J \hat y_j}{\sum^{J}_{j=1}N_J} \text{ where } \hat y_j = \frac{1}{n_J} \sum_{i = 1}^{n_J} y_i  ,
\end{equation}

where $\hat y^{post}$ is the estimator of $y$ in the strata $j$, $N_J$ the size of the j-th strata in the population and $n_J$ the size of the j-th strata in the sample. From the equation it is obvious that post-stratification is only feasible if we have at least one observation for each strata ($n_J > 0$). But even for small strata sizes in the sample ($n_J < 30$) the standard errors will be large. This is a serious issue as the number of strata grows rapidly with each characteristic included. If we use for instance two gender categories and four age groups we have eight strata, if we add past vote (7 categories) we already have 54. As a result, we might only have a few individuals for each strata or even none. This has severe consequences: For example, estimating the population frequency of the strata female, old (60+) and FDP voter in 2013 with only few respondents in the sample will come with a large error.

Furthermore, our effort to post-stratification comes with another problem: Publically available data often only includes the distribution of pairs of characteristics or, in rare cases, triples (e.g. age, gender and past vote). Yet, the ideal would be to have the frequencies of strata of all variables that is correlated to the voting behaviour of a person. These would be certainly gender and age but also employment status, income, education and religion.^[Formally speaking, we need to know the number of individuals in each strata $N_j$] Knowing this distribution would enable us to fine tune our forecast. However, as they are not available we will concentrate on combination of characteristics where we have the joint distribtutions. These are in particular age, gender and past votes (from exit polls) as well as combinations of age, gender and religion from the census. 

The prior mentioned problem of empty strata can be address in two ways: *Filling strata by aggregating* or with *model-based post-stratification*. Aggregation works simple: If a strata is empty, it has to be combined along one variable with another one. For example: In the December 2016 data set there was no female women above 60 who voted FDP in 2013. In order to address this problem, the age groups 45-59 and 60+ were combined. This is ad-hoc, but a common practice to address empty stratas. There is one alternative: In the model-based post-stratification approach the estimates for each strata are not based on the average in the strata as in the equation above, but the result of a multinomial logistic regression. In order to arrive at this regression results, demographic variables in the sample can be used. We did not implement this because the necessary packages for this are not yet released by @Goel.2017.^[They are developing an R package for this (postr) and already anounced to make it public.]

## Likely voter models

By the time we post-stratified and weighted our sample to resemble the population (first approach), we have not yet accounted for the problem of likely voter bias. Surveys tend to either include voters who say they will vote but eventually do not do so, or include voters who say they will not vote but finally cast a ballot [@Bernstein.2001]. Since this behaviour of individuals has turned out to be correlated across party preferences it is likely to bias our forecast [@Keeter.2016]. 

Two families of methods are proposed by @Keeter.2016 to account for likely voter bias - *deterministic* and *propabilistic* methods. The former was initially proposed in @Perry.1960 and @Perry.1979 and tries to identify criteria that describe a voter as a likely voter on a scale from 0-7. Using a distinct set of questions such as "How likely are you to vote at the next national election?" respondents are assigned points on the likely voter scale and are eventually ranked. Using an estimate of the upcoming election turnout, a cut-of criteria determines which rank on the likely voter scale is needed to be included in the sample measuring the actual voting population.

The downside of such methods is that people below the threshold value of the scale have no affect at all on the actual forecast. This is addressed by probabilistic methods. Such an approach estimates on the basis of a set of predictor variables like demographic characteristics, partisanship or ideology a probability of a person to cast a ballot. By using this probability even people with a very low likelihood of voting affect the actual estimate to a certain degree. The downside of such methods is that it requires data on turnout and the predictor variables of the past election. Moreover, such models assume that turnout is time-stable for the population groups across past and future elections.[@Keeter.2016]

For the purposes of our calibration we decided to use the simplest deterministic approach: Self-reported vote intention. For further fine-tuning we could employ other approaches, but our analysis (see below) showed that for our data set the post-stratification is more crucial.
