<!-- Conclusion -->

In this paper, we tested different adjustment methods for online election polls conducted through smartphone apps. The data is highly unrepresentative of the voting population and yields unreasonable results in its raw format. By using different post-stratification methods we calibrated the polls and produced reasonable election forecasts. We find that weighting with self-reported past vote is a promising approach to correct online polls, while our purely demographic approach did not perform well. But this result might be the consequence of choosing the wrong demographic variables: Age and gender were already considered in pre-stratification and religion had a measurement problem. A possible alternative would be to use other variables for post-stratification, e.g. education, employment status or information on the urbanization which are considered by Dalia for pre-stratification. Our second approach, weighting with clusters of age, gender and self-reported voting decision in 2013 against exit poll data, yielded weights that performed relatively well compared to aggregated polls. We conclude that exit poll data is useful to account for voting population representativeness and likely voter bias. 

The shortcomings of our approach were twofold. First, since the exit polls do not report AfD voters across clusters of age and gender, we had to impute this data from the aggregated data of Other parties, were the AfD is included. This induced error and probably reduced the accuracy of our AfD forecast. Second, our approach assumes that the clusters of actual voters remain constant from 2013 to 2017. But introducting more complex assumptions on the characteristics of likely voters requires more sophisticated methods of identification. Such 'likely voters models' as explained in chapter 4.2 and the employment of more detailed cluster of exit poll data would presumably make our polls even more accurat. However, our primary aim was to show that non-representative online polls can be adjusted to produce reasonable results. In order to publish the forecasts further fine-tuning would be required.
