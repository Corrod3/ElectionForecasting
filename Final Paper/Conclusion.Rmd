<!-- Conclusion -->

In this paper, we tested different weighting methods applied on an online election poll conducted through Smartphone apps. Showing that the data was highly unrepresentative for the voting population, yielding unreasonable results, we motivated usage of different weighting methods to obtain better forecasts. Comparing our weighted vote shares with the rolling average of leading German polling institute's forecasts, we conclude that proper weighting with public available data is feasible to adjust online polls well benchmarked to traditional ones. Our approach to weight by combined clusters of gender, age and religious views collected from the German Census and using self-reported turnout as identification tool for likely voter performed badly. A possible alternative would have been the adjustment using instead of age, education, employment status or other demographic information, that are not accounted by Dalia within the data generating process. Our second appriach, weighting with clusters of age, gender and self-reported voting decision in 2013 against exit poll data, yielded weights that performed relatively well compared to our benchmark. We conclude that exit poll data is useful to account for voting population representativeness and likely voter bias in order to utilize online surveys for polling.

The shortcomings of our approach were twofold. First, since the exit polls do not report AfD voters across clusters of age and gender, we had to impute this data from the aggregated data of Other parties, were the AfD is included. This induced error and probably reduced the accuracy of our AfD forecast. Second, our approach assumes that the clusters of actual voters remain constant from 2013 to 2017. But introducting more complex assumptions on the characteristics of likely voters requires more sophisticated methods of identification. Such 'likely voters models' as explained in chapter 4.2 and the employment of more detailed cluster of exit poll data would presumably make our polls even more accurat. However, such research shall be the scope of future projects to assess the performance of online polls for election forecasting.
