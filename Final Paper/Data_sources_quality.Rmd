## Data sources and potential biases


### The Dalia Research' Europulse

In this paper, we are using data from [Dalia Research](https://daliaresearch.com/), an online polling firm which is conducting market and opinion research exclusively through smartphones. To ensure to collect data from a broad variety of target populations, Dalia is using a diverse set of app and website categories such as sports, news, entertainment or games. To control that participants answer the survey seriously, an algorithm analyses the consistency and the response behaviour and computes a "trust score" to every respondent. Dalia praises its methodology as distinctively accounting for potential biases such as interviewer effect, social desirability bias or interviewer data entry errors. [@Dalia.2016] 

Our forecasting project utilizes data of Dalia Research's Europulse Survey which is conducted quarterly in all EU countries. The survey consists of seven waves, but for this project we only use two waves of the survey from December 2016 and March 2017. The first wave is freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/daliaresearch/trump-effect), the second wave was provided to us directly by Dalia Research.^[The data for the first wave was collected between 5th and 15th of December 2016. The second wave was conducted between 13th to 27th of March 2017.] Each wave consists of about 11000 individuals, of which roughly 1900 were from Germany which is the fraction of respondents we will focus on in the following analysis. The data is already pre-stratified by Dalia Research based on micro census data for age, gender.^[Dalia Research also provides weights from the micro census in their data. However, since we do not know the methodology used to obtain these weights we will employ our own weighting algorithm for Census adjustment.] 

The Europulse data is not particularly collected for election forecasting purposes but contains data on a variety of questions such as online behaviour, media consumption and personal views on political and societal development in the European Union and the respondent's country of origin. Moreover, the survey contains information on the respondent's personal background, demographic data and his or her financial situation. These data can be utilized in order to improve the representativeness of the survey through weighting. This will be explained more detailed in the methodology section.

The election-related variables collected in the Europulse survey are similar to traditional vote intention polling questions. First of all, the respondents are asked if and for which party they will vote in the upcoming election and for which party they voted in the previous election. Moreover, they are asked to rank political parties and describe the degree of certainty to cast a ballot for a particular party. Important for our analysis is a variable containing self-reported voting decision at the past German federal election, since we exploit this data compute survey weights that adjust the data to demographic composition of the past election in 2013.


### Raw forecasts and data quality

As with all surveys, the methodology of Dalia Research has several sources of potential biases. In the case of the Europulse survey they are primarily from flawed measurement and representation of the surveyed population, as listed in figure 1 [@Groves.2009].

<!-- measurement error -->
With regard to measuring vote intention for a particular party, the Europulse survey uses a similar approach as traditional surveys: it asks respondents directly which party they intent to vote for at the upcoming election. Whether such questions measure correctly the actual voting behaviour at the election day is questionable but the approach does not differ significantly from traditional polling methods.^[The extact question used for instance by _infratest dimap_, a major german polling firm, is: "What party would you vote for if there would be a Federal election next Sunday." [@infratest.2017] This wording is slightly different than in the Dalia questionaire but evaluating the impact of the formulation of questions shall not be content of this study.] However, online surveys, such as Europulse, can reasonably claim to avoid some sources of measurement error such as social desirability bias or interviewer bias. Since such surveys are often anonymous, the social pressure on the respondent is presumably negligible, and interaction with the interviewer does not bias the response.

<!-- representativeness: Self-selection bias and sampling error --> 
Regarding representativeness, the Europulse survey has some limitations in comparison to face-to-face or RDD interviews. First of all, Europulse' framework does not select participants at random but offers visitors of certain websites or app-users the opportunity to participate. Hence, this approach carries the risk of self-selection. Moreover, representativeness would require that the Europulse survey in principle should be available to the entire population. However, not everyone is using smartphones and even if they are, they might not use the applications Dalia targets for its surveys. The users Dalia Research actually tends to reach are likely to be much younger and technology oriented than the general population would be (see figure). This is in particular a problem for election polling, as older voters are systematically underrepresented in such online methodologies while turnout amongst the elderly tends to be higher compared to the young population.

  \caption{Internet usage and turnout by age}
\end{figure}

<!-- Dalia response -->
Dalia Research tries to account for these problems. First, as we have mentioned, they try to increase the diversity of their respondents by presenting their surveys on various apps and platforms targeting different user groups. Second, they pre- and post-stratify their data. Pre-stratification is done on the basis of age and gender, using self-reported demographic information. For each age and gender strata they target a certain number of respondents so that their sample resembles roughly the German population. In a second step, they use data from the German Census and compute weights for cluster of age, gender, education and whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area. The methodology how Dalia obtained these weights remained not transparent to us. For that reason we used our own approach for post-stratification that specifically addressed our purpose of election forecasting. Finally, Dalia tries to avoid selection bias since they to not inform respondents that they are answering an election related survey before they actually start it and in general Dalia Research has high completion rates, hence participants are only rarely dropping out after they started a survey.

Despite these efforts, it is questionable whether the data can be regarded as representative. Below we present a simple frequency table of the seld-reported past election turnout as well as the intended vote at the next election for the most recent wave of Europulse. The tables show that the results are significantly diverging from other forecasts (see [www.wahlumfragen.org](https://www.wahlumfragen.org/bundestagswahl/wahlumfragen_bundestagswahl.php)).

The large divergence from can be due to a variety of flaws that bias Europulse. First of all, even if the sample represents the German population in terms of age groups and gender, it can be question whether the old female or male users are truly representative of their age group. Moreover, not revealing the survey content might sort out political motivated respondents, but interest in political matters is likely correlated to general willingness to respond to surveys. Hence, in order to utilize the data to election forecasting further weighting and post-stratification will be necessary.
 
## Official election statistics and Census

The data used for post-stratification and weighting come from several sources. Our primary secondary data is obtained from the German official election statistics. [@Bundeswahlleiter.2017] It contains combined information of turnout and voting decision by gender and age. Age is clustered in groups of 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-60 and 60 plus. This data is the closest estimate of the actual voting population available and is a common measure to account for likely voter bias.

To adjust our sample to demographic composition of the German population we use data of the German [Zensus 2011](https://www.zensus2011.de/DE/Home/home_node.html). The data is freely available and we obtained combined frequencies foras age, gender, education and confession. The Census claims to reflect the actual demographic distribution of the German population and hence is suitable in order to post-stratify our sample to demographic criteria. Both, election statistics and Census is the basis on which we adjust our raw data to obtain representative results.

<!-- benchmark data -->
Finally, in order to set our forecasts into context we will use polling data from other institutes. The daily newspaper *Süddeutsche Zeitung* has recently started to modernize their approach on polling. Leaning on the famous approach of the American statistician Nate Silver [SOURCE POLLING THE POLLS] they computed a rolling average of all major German polling institutes forecasts. [SOURCE] To meet full transparency criteria they published their data (from [wahlrecht.de](wahlrecht.de)) and their R-code on GitHub. We utilized their efforts and use the rolling average as benchmark to assess how our estimates perform.

<!-- put here other data shortcommings of the weighting data -->
Finally, as well as the Dalia data, the weighting data suffers from a variety of problems. Most important, the exit poll data we use to compute our weights is not clustered for voters of the *Alternative für Deutschland* (AfD). In order to compute the vote share among groups of age and gender we took the share of the total election results that the AfD got among all parties that are summarized among *Others*. The weak spot of this approach is that it assumes a equal distribution of AfD voters across all groups of age and gender. While this assumption is very unlikely it is the best approximation we can get with the data at hand. 

Moreover, the Census as well as the election statistics do not provide combined frequencies of more than three dimensions of demographic variables. This makes it impossible to weight the data on a large set of criteria. Yet, since our Dalia dataset is to small to compute more than three-dimensional cluster anyways that has no severe impact on our methdology.
