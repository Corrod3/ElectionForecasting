# Election Forecasting

This repository is part of a course on Election Forecasting at Hertie School of Governance. We are using smart phone polling data to generate polling election forecasts for the German federal elections in 2017. The GitHub repository includes the written assignments as well as the script. The data we are using is only particially included here, as some of the data was not officially released by the polling company. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us: [Alex](mailto:a.sacharow@mpp.hertie-school.org) or [Moritz](mailto:m.hemmerlein@mpp.hertie-school.org).
